BTS (base transceiver station) -> Tower + room

In Room -> RBS (Radio Base Station), TX (Transimision Equipment), Power

RBS -> Sensor, consumes more power (35 amps)
TX -> Sensor, consumes less power, MUST NOT BE DOWN, battery backup keeps it alive (15 amps)
Power -> Sensor, Distribution board, battery backup, Rectifier (Controls the total power)

AG -> Auto generator

Towers unique identfier -> TX and RBS

Batter -> Critical load (TX), non-critial load (RBS)
When DB is out, depends on bat (48 volt general , 52/53 volt (swing voltage)) (44 -> RBS down, TX up)
42 -> Tx down
52-42 -> 8-10 hours, or 16-20 hours if many towers

Circle ante (Mhz)
calls -> Long ante (GHz) -> rbs, tx -> circle -> connects to other mobile

BSC -> Base station controller
- Many towers are connected to BSC
- Call authentication

MSC -> Master station controller, very sophisticated
- Many BSCs are connected
- Call authentication


# Alarms
- MF: Mains Fail, power has gone out
- Batt: When 45 volts
